# Ministries of RCC

We take responsibility for improving the well-being of our city, Almaty, for fulfilling God's will in all of our relationships. We strive towards together starting with our mutual spiritual upbringing in faithfulness to God and charity towards our neighbors in all aspects of our lives. We pray, praise God, study the Bible, and tell others about Jesus. We desire to attain [simple and pure genuine faith](/doctrine.html). We also meet in small groups, organize social events, and youth gatherings.
